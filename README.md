# Aperiodic_CP
Code for a (continuous time) Monte Carlo simulation of a aperiodic contact process (the main file is **acp_abax.c**). This code is best used concomitantly with the [cluster.sh](https://github.com/ArielYssou/Cluster) script. There are also basic data analysis codes, both in C and Python.
